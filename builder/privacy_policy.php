    <h2>9. Language</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy is written in English. In the event of any conflict between the English version and translated versions, the English version shall prevail.</p>
    <p>Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of our privacy policy is of paramount importance to us. We understand that our users may come from diverse linguistic backgrounds and regions, and we strive to make our policies accessible to as many users as possible by offering translations into multiple languages.</p>
    <p>However, it is crucial to recognize that when providing translations, there may be instances where discrepancies or misunderstandings arise between the translated versions and the original English version. To address this potential issue and maintain the highest level of transparency and clarity, we have established the following policy regarding language conflicts:</p>
    <h3>9.1. The Primacy of the English Version</h3>
    <p>The English version of this privacy policy is considered the authoritative and legally binding version. In cases where there is any discrepancy, contradiction, or ambiguity between the English version and any translated version, the provisions outlined in the English version shall take precedence and govern the interpretation and application of this policy.</p>
    <h3>9.2. Rationale for English Primacy</h3>
    <p>The decision to prioritize the English version is not taken lightly but is rooted in practical and legal considerations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal Clarity:</strong> English is the original language in which this privacy policy was drafted. It is essential to maintain a single authoritative version to prevent legal disputes and ensure that users' rights and obligations are clearly defined.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Consistency in language and terminology is vital for the accurate interpretation and enforcement of our privacy policy. The English version serves as the reference point for achieving this consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> In some jurisdictions, English versions of legal documents are legally required to be maintained as the primary reference in case of disputes or legal actions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>9.3. Commitment to Transparency</h3>
    <p>We are committed to providing clear and transparent communication with our users regarding their privacy rights and how their personal information is handled. We understand that language differences can pose challenges, and we are continuously working to improve our translations to make our policies more accessible.</p>
